                <p>A chronicle of one person&apos;s journey to consciousness.

                       An example of how one person was able to awaken from an unconscious state
                       into knowing and realizing her purpose by learning and incorporating teachings of metaphysics.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong>
                <p>When I was young, when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer would
                       change every time. An actress, a singer, a teacher, a counselor, a musician, a
                       sex therapist, a chef, a stand-up comedian; you name it, I wanted to <em>do</em> it at some
                        point. However, there was always one common answer that would always accompany these
                         various professions: I wanted to be a Mommy.</p>
                <p>I&apos;ve always known that I wanted a family. As I matured, so did my vision of my future.
                         I dreamt of being the stereotypical suburban housewife, who takes great care in the
                         cleanliness and peacefulness of her home, while vacuuming in her pearls (channeling my
                         inner June Cleaver). The type of woman who put the happiness and health of her family at
                         the top of her priorities. The mom who promoted her kids&apos; interests, went to soccer practice,
                          ballet recitals, and spelling bees and still had a nutritious meal on the table for her family
                           each day. A wife, who was her husband&apos;s teammate, his rock, his muse and his reflection.
                           The perfect mother for his children, classy, and a sexual dynamo in the bedroom. This all-
                           encompassing woman, in addition to attending to her family&apos;s well-being, was also constantly
                           pursuing her own goals and passions, making use of set aside time to read, research, and further
                           her own life purpose. I could see myself as this person so clearly, and I coined the term Mommy-Mogul.
                            A super wife and mother, holding a cell phone in one hand, spatula in the other, wearing an apron over
                             her work attire, standing atop a hill behind a white picket fence. Maybe even a cape flowing behind
                             her. Oh yeah, I wanted to be her!</p>
                <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/busy-black-woman-mother-multitask-work-baby-african-american-pretty-young-mom-doing-simultaneously-many-things-78073814.jpg" />

                <p>Then, I encountered a few curveballs. I moved in with the first guy I dated, flunked out of college,
                        had a child of my own, and experienced the deterioration of that first relationship. That fantasy of the
                         super mom came crashing down in gigantic shards of &quot;reality&quot;. Suddenly, there were all of these expectations:
                         what it means to be a parent, what it means to be a single mom, what it means to be a &quot;black&quot; single mom,
                         what it means to be someone&apos;s &quot;baby mama.&quot; of these layers conflicted with my original vision of the kind
                         of parent, and the kind of person I wanted to be, and became heavier and heavier.</p>
                <p>Approximately 10 years after I graduated high school, I found myself right back where I started:
                        my mom&apos;s basement. Only this time I came bearing the weight of bad life choices, plenty of regrets, and an
                        amazing little girl who I felt that I had failed. But, what can you do? Give up? So I just continued to go
                        through the motions. I was on autopilot. I would get up, get my daughter to school, go to work, come home,
                        sleep and do it all again. Sometimes weeks would go by and I wouldn&apos;t even notice. I would look up and another
                        month had gone by, and I&apos;d say &quot;what have I accomplished?&quot; This led to depression, anxiety, fatigue, panic attacks,
                        and feelings of utter despair. While lying awake at night, or beating traffic to get to work I would find myself
                        wanting so desperately to wake up. To realize that this haze that I lived in daily was a dream. &quot;There has to be more
                         to life than this! This can&apos;t be it!&quot; I would tell myself. &quot;This can&apos;t be all that I was sent here to do. Work my ass
                          off, pay taxes, grow old, and die? No sir, not me!&quot;</p>
                <p>I decided to change. It was a mental change first. I thought about what my goals are, what will make me happy.
                        Even though I was not sure what my life&apos;s calling was, or what my dream job would be or how to get there, I knew
                         that there were certain steps that I could take to live happier. I began exploring my options. I said to myself
                         that at this moment in my life, there are things that I cannot change at this time. Instead I asked myself, &quot;What
                          things can I change right now that will help me better myself?&quot;</p>
                <p>Well, I can take control of my health. I can incorporate more activity. I can devote more time to things that I enjoy.
                        I looked for ways to improve my current station in life. It made me feel more empowered, more in control of my life,
                         even just taking those small steps. And from making those small changes, I experienced more clarity and peace, and
                         was able to then focus more on what my purpose in life was. Before making those changes, I felt as if my mind was
                         clouded with so many layers that it made it hard to focus. But by taking control of the things within my grasp, I
                         freed myself of unnecessary stress and worry, and was able to hone in on the things that really mattered.</p>

                <p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
                <p>I am creating Meta-Mommy-Mogul for anyone who can relate to my journey. Anyone who has ever thought, &quot;There must be
                       more to life!&quot; Women, men, single, married, parents, young, old. I am positive that there are people who have had
                       similar situations to mine, with similar feelings, and who are looking for a way out but are unable to see it through
                       the fog of everyday life. This is for those who are seeking to step into their true calling, to feel purposeful and
                       useful, productive and abundant.</p>
                <p>I invite everyone to join me at <a href="https://metamommymogul.wordpress.com/">Meta-Mommy-Mogul</a> where you can kick
                        back, grab a snack and a blanket, and be prepared to laugh, learn and share with me. I am
                        by no means an expert, or a certified doctor or psychologist, or a medical professional. I&apos;m just a woman who wants
                        to share her journey with others who can relate. Hopefully you find something that makes sense to you so we can embark
                         on this journey through life together!</p>
